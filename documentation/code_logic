The system uses a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W to monitor electrical power consumption, detect smoke hazards, trigger alerts, and send real-time data to ThingSpeak using Wi-Fi.

Importing Required Libraries:

The following MicroPython libraries are imported:

machine.I2C & Pin → To configure I²C communication and GPIO pins

INA219 → To read voltage, current, and power values

utime → To introduce time delays

urequests → To send data to ThingSpeak using HTTP

network → To connect to Wi-Fi

gc → To perform garbage collection and free memory

This ensures the microcontroller can access sensors, Wi-Fi, and cloud APIs.

Then Network Configuration.

Initiate I2C Bus.

Initializing the INA219 Power Sensor.

Setting Up Smoke Sensor & Buzzer.

WiFi Connection Function.

Sending Data to ThingSpeak.

Main Loop Operation. In this all the sensors are initialized and switched to working state.
